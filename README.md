## GSoC-2025 @ HumanAI > ISSR > "Communication Analysis Tool for Human-AI Interaction Driving Simulator Experiments"

### Description of the project:
The project basically focuses on building up of a fully-functional prototype of the AI-driven communication analysis tool, which explores and analyzes the high-fidelity audiovisual data of communication between the individuals involved in driving simulation. It helps to better understand the group dynamics, improvising safety measures, and incorporating (AI and machine learning / natural language processing) in the real-world driving scenarios. The project involves advanced NLP and visualization techniques. The key features of the tool includes - Data ingestion, Data processing, Key variable extraction, Speaker identification, Timestamping, Content analysis, Dynamic Reporting, User interface, and User-centric customization.
